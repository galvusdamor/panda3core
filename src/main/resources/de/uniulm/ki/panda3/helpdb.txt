Available options for PANDA:

To run PANDA, you have to specify at least a domain and a problem file. For most parameters, their order does not matter. Parameters can be freely interleaved with the specification of a domain, problem, and output file.
\n
PANDA's general call syntax is as follows:
    java -jar panda.jar [OPTIONS] domfile.xyz [OPTIONS] probfile.xyz [OPTIONS] [outputfile.{pdf|dot}] [OPTIONS]
\n
If you want to use PANDA for scientific comparisons, we highly recommend to use the respective pre-defined system configurations using "-systemConfig" to prevent a misconfiguration of the system.

Suppress additional information during planning.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "-noSearchInfo" IS A SWITCH, NOT AN OPTION.

By default, the planners will show -- during planning -- their current search process. This information includes, for example, the number of created nodes per second, the number of expanded search nodes, and the number of nodes in the queue.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-continueOnSolution
Don't stop planning after a solution has been found.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "-continueOnSolution" IS A SWITCH, NOT AN OPTION.

By default, the standard PANDA3 planner will stop after some solution has been generated. Using this option will cause the planner to continue search and finding additional solutions until the time or space limit is exceeded.
\n
This feature has never been tested sufficiently and is very likely buggy. That is, please do not use it for scientific comparisons.
$





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-noDomainInfo
Suppressed information about the domain.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "-noDomainInfo" IS A SWITCH, NOT AN OPTION.

By default, the planner gives statistical information about the domain, for example the number of tasks, primitive tasks, abstract tasks, decomposition methods, predicates, sorts, and constants. Using this option supresses this information.
\n
Please note that this information is shown several times: Many of our heuristics base upon very basic language features, that is: a ground model in which primitive tasks have only positive preconditions. Also our decomposition methods do not have preconditions (as opposed to the SHOP2 model) or effects (yes, some hierarchical planning formalisms even allow effects of methods). We compile all these higher-level language features away and after each compilation step the domain information is printed (if not supressed).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-planningProcedure
Choose the planning procedure.
Available planning procedures:

PANDA is more than just "one planning system". Apart from additional capabilities like repairing and explaining plans (not yet provided online), or validating plans, we also have two differently working planners (only one of them is provided online at the moment). While these planners share the same preprocessing, e.g., grounding, they are completely different in the way they solve problems.
\n
At the moment, we only support the "traditional" PANDA, but in its newest version, PANDA3, which performs search in the space of partial plans. We refer to its search procedure as hybrid planning, because it fuses hierarchical planning with partial order causal link (POCL) planning. The algorithm is a standard flaw-based POCL algorithm that can additionally cope with abstract tasks. It is explained in the following paper:

Please note that this plan space-based planning algorithm requires a search algorithm (like BFS or A*) and a flaw selection function.

We further want to note that this planner is able of solving a broad variety of problem classes, including HTN problems, TIHTN problems (HTN problems with task insertion), hybrid problems with or without task insertion (these problems extend HTN/TIHTN problems via preconditions and effects of abstract tasks and by causal links in the domain model's partial plans), classical problems, and POCL problems (which are like classical problems, but with an initial primitive partial plan). Please note that the property whether task insertion is allowed cannot be passed on to the planner as an option, but it needs to be specified in the domain or problem file, since this is not an algorithmic choice, but a property of the problem (class) that is solved.

Please note that our planners currently do not support action costs, i.e., we assume cost 1 for each primitive action.

\n
Please note that you can select a sequence of flaw selection strategies for tie-breaking. To give such a sequence, use a semicolon-separated list of flaw selection functions without whitespaces. Specifying sequences of flaw selection functions makes sense to be more discriminative about the flaw to be actually selected, because the first flaw selection function might not restrict the set of candidate flaws to a single one, so adding a second (third, etc.) selection function reduces the available flaws in this set reducing the impact of randomness.

lcfr
Least-Cost Flaw-Repair (restrict to flaws with a minimal modification branching factor).
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "lcfr" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

The flaw selection strategy lcfr, Least-Cost Flaw-Repair, for the plan space-based PANDA3 algorithm is both extremely simple and efficient: it always selects a flaw for which there are the least number of "repairs", i.e., plan modifications. That way, the branching factor of the explored search space is locally minimized, which shows empirically good results on average.
\n
It was introduced in the following paper:

  Abstract                 = {We describe the least-cost flaw repair (LCFR) strategy for performing flaw selection during partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. LCFR can be seen as a generalization of Peot and Smith's "Delay-Unforced Threats" (DUnf) strategy [Peot & Smith 1993]; where DUnf treats threats differently from open conditions, LCFR has a uniform mechanism for handling all flaws. We provide experimental results that demonstrate that the power of DUnf does not come from delaying threat repairs per se, but rather from the fact that this delay has the effect of imposing a partial preference for least-cost flaw selection. Our experiments also show that extending this to a complete preference for least-cost selection reduces search-space size even further. We consider the computational overhead of employing LCFR, and discuss techniques for reducing this overhead. In particular, we describe QLCFR, a strategy that reduces computational overhead by approximating repair costs.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
front-flaw
Restrict to flaws that are closest to the initial state.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "front-flaw" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

This flaw selection function for the plan space-based PANDA3 algorithm selects a flaw that is closest to the initial state (i.e., to the artificial action encoding that state). That is, only flaws are selected that do not possess a predecessor in a plan. For causal threat flaws, its "earliest" plan component determines its distance to init, i.e., the causal link's producer or the threatening plan step (which ever is closer to init).
$

Restrict to flaws that were introduced most recently.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "newest-flaw" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

This flaw selection function for the plan space-based PANDA3 algorithm selects a flaw that was introduced most recently.
\n
Relying on that strategy somehow resembles a depth-first search regarding flaws. In a hierarchical setting, this means that deeper expansions are preferred before shallow ones (and before inserting certain causal links). In the non-hierarchical POCL setting, this means that first a totally ordered action sequence is generated that eventually roots in the initial state before other preconditions are supported.

We implement our ideas in a variant of UCPOP called REPOP1. Our empirical results show that in addition to dominating UCPOP, REPOP also convincingly outperforms Graphplan in several “parallel” domains. The plans generated by REPOP also tend to be better than those generated by Graphplan and state search planners in terms of execution flexibility.}

You can specify a sequence of heuristics by putting a semicolon in between them. Only the first heuristic is used by the actual search algorithm (such as A*) and the remaining ones are used to break ties (the smaller the better).

tdg-m-lifted
TDG-m for lifted planning.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "tdg-m-lifted" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

This is a heuristic for the plan space-based PANDA3 algorithm. It is the lifted variant of the TDG-m heuristic (i.e., it gives admissible estimates of the number of modifications requiried to turn a current plan into a solution).
\n
This variant does not perform recomputation and it is suited for lifted planning, where the plan steps in search nodes may still contain variables. For this, given a plan step, it first builds all groundings for this step and retrieves all corresponding heuristic values from the TDG, of which it retrieves the minimum.
\n
Since this heuristic is based upon the TDG and this TDG in turn depends on the planning graph (PG), options concerning the PG also influence this heuristic. We use our *default PG* for the heuristic, which does not use mutexes. However, if you change this default (by specifying which PG is used via the option "-primitiveReachability"), then this improved PG is used for the heuristic.

\n
*Please note that at the moment, our planner does not yet have the capability to cope with action costs. For this reason, this heuristic assumes unit costs, i.e., it currently estimates the number of actions that have to be inserted.

tdg-m tdg-m-ground
TDG-m for ground planning.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "tdg-m" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

This is a heuristic for the plan space-based PANDA3 algorithm. It is the standard variant of the TDG-m heuristic (i.e., it gives admissible estimates of the number of modifications requiried to turn a current plan into a solution).
\n
This standard variant does *not* perform any recomputation of the underlying task decompostion graph (TDG) and it is suited for ground planning, where all plan steps in all search nodes are always ground.
\n
Since this heuristic is based upon the TDG and this TDG in turn depends on the planning graph (PG), options concerning the PG also influence this heuristic. We use our *default PG* for the heuristic, which does not use mutexes. However, if you change this default (by specifying which PG is used via the option "-primitiveReachability"), then this improved PG is used for the heuristic.

In a nutshell, this heuristic takes *some* of the open preconditions of the current partial plan (i.e., a subset of those that are not protected by a causal link) and uses them as goal state the achievement of which is estimated relying on the Add heuristic for classical planning (however, the underlying planning graph is calculated only once, because the "current state" is always the initial state). Instead of taking *all* unprotected preconditions (as the Add heuristic for POCL planning does), the Add-r heuristic only takes those open preconditions for which there is no action in the current partial plan that can, occording to the ordering and variable constraints, potentially be used as a supporter.

Our key insight is that the techniques responsible for the efficiency of the currently successful planners–viz., distance based heuristics, reachability analysis and disjunctive constraint handling–can also be adapted to dramatically improve the efficiency of the POP algorithm. We implement our ideas in a variant of UCPOP called REPOP1. Our empirical results show that in addition to dominating UCPOP, REPOP also convincingly outperforms Graphplan in several “parallel” domains. The plans generated by REPOP also tend to be better than those generated by Graphplan and state search planners in terms of execution flexibility.}

\n
In a nutshell, this heuristic takes all open preconditions of the current partial plan (i.e., those that are not protected by a causal link) and uses them as goal state the achievement of which is estimated relying on the FF heuristic for classical planning (however, the underlying (serial) planning graph is calculated only once, because the "current state" is always the initial state). The cost of the extracted relaxed plan is used as heuristic. However, actions in that relaxed plan that do also occur in the input partial plan do not contribute towards the heuristic.

As it is the case for the Add and Add-r heuristic for POCL planning, this heuristic can not only be applied to non-hierarchical problems, but to all that can be solved by PANDA3. In case of hierarchical problems, the heuristic either ignores abstract tasks (in case they do not have preconditions, as is the case of HTN and TIHTN problems) or they are "regarded primitive", i.e. their preconditions are used as well in case they have some specified (as is the case for hybrid problems).

Random seeds are used to systematically evaluate the impact of randomness in our systems.

By default, all planners perform some domain simplifications. The following optimizations/simplifications are performed:
\n
(1) predicates that do not occur in preconditions are eliminated
\n
(2) unreachable primitive and abstract tasks are eliminated as follows:
- A mutex-free variable-relaxed planning graph (pg) is constructed
- all primitive actions not contained in this pg are removed from the model
- all methods containing removed actions are removed as well
- abstract tasks without remaining methods are removed

Please note that this planning graph is not only used for creating the ground model. Even if you do *not* plan if a ground way (i.e., lifted, which you can do by using "-liftedPlanning"), then creating this planning graph might still produce a smaller *lifted* model (i.e., lifted actions get removed if there isn't a reachable grounding). Furthermore, some heuristics use the planning graph that is created here (this is noted in the respective heuristic).
\n
The reachability analysis needs to take one of two parameters:
- pg (describes the mutex-free planning graph) and
- pgm (describes the planning graph using mutexes).
Pass on the option by putting it in parentheses behind the option. By default, the primitiveReachability is *activated* and it *does* use mutexes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-noPrimitiveReachability
Do not rely on the planning graph for grounding the primitive tasks.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "-noPrimitiveReachability" IS A SWITCH, NOT AN OPTION.

If you plan in a *ground* fashion (this is done by default) and this option is chosen, then the ground model is obtained by naively building all groundings -- without performing any reachability analysis (this is highly unrecommended, do not do this).
\n
If you plan in a *lifted* fashion (you had to explicitly choose so), then choosing this option prevents the grounding process altogether. (However, the cleanup option might still delete some of the unreachable actions if activated.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-hierarchicalReachability
Use the task decomposition graph for grounding.
Available options for -hierarchicalReachability:

When ever a hierarchical problem is solved, we rely on the grounded task decomposition graph (TDG) in order to ground the model. The *result* of this process is always the same ground TDG. The different ways of creating this have different runtime properties and space requirements, however. The resulting TFG is used both for ground planning (as it describes a ground model), but also for lifted planning (similar to the planning graph, the ground model can also be used to reduce the lifted model), as well as for some heuristics, which are also based upon a ground TDG.
\n
The resulting TDG is described in the following paper:

As noted, the process of *how* this ground TDG is built has a strong influence on its performance in terms of runtime and maximal memory usage. We offer various ways how to construct it. See the respective help pages (using -help) for a description of the respective keys.
\n
Please also note that the TDG *always* relies on a planning graph (PG) in order to restrict the TDG to a subgraph that only contains actions that are reachable -- which is identified relying on the PG. More specifically, the planningPG that is used as a basis for the TDG is the very same one resulting from the option (-primitiveReachablity) -- so choosing to create this PG with or without mutexes has an influence on this hierarchical reachability as well. Furthermore, the TDG-based heuristics directly rely on this resulting TDG.
\n
Note that using the TDG for grounding is activated by default, *even* if lifted planning is chosen. In the latter case, the resulting ground TDG is used to eliminate certain lifted tasks and methods (a lifted task/method can be eliminated from the model if there is no reachable grounding). By default, we use the option "twoWay", as it is -- empirically -- the best-performing one on average.

THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "naive" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

This key for the -hierarchicalReachability option builds the Task Decomposition Graph (TDG) in a naive way that is intended for debugging purposes only. Instead of doing it bottom-up, top-down, or in a hybrid manner, this variant first builds the entire ground model without performing any reachability analysis, and then restricts the model to the respective TDG that can be obtained from the top-down reachability and by restricting to actions that are reachable relying on the relaxed planning graph.

THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "-noHierarchicalReachability" IS A SWITCH, NOT AN OPTION.

If you plan in a *ground* fashion (this is done by default) and this option is chosen, then the ground model is obtained by naively building all groundings -- without performing any reachability analysis (this is highly unrecommended, do not do this).

$ recompute-htn planLength



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
recompute-htn
Prune a plan based on hierarchical reachability.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "recompute-htn" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

This pruning criterion discards a plan if and only if the recomputation-based TDG-based heuristics published at IJCAI 2017 (see -TDG-m-rec for a short description) would return a heuristic value of infinity.
\n
In a nutshell, given a current search node (with at least one abstract task) the pruning technique builds a new task decomposion graph (TDG) for that very search node (which includes creating a planning graph relying on the primitive tasks contained in that TDG) and checks whether every abstract task in the given plan can be decomposed into a primitive plan in which all actions are contained in the PG. If so, nothing is done; if not, it is discarded. As is the case with the TDG-c and TDG-m heuristics, the TDG resulting from the -hierarchicalReachability is used as the basis.
\n
Please note that in its current stage, this pruning technique is not as efficient as it could be. More precisely, the TDG is built for *every* search node, which is far more calculation effort than actually necessary. In the before-mentioned IJCAI paper, we have shown that in many cases rebuilding the TDG is not beneficial and the heuristic values could be calculated incrementally; in these cases, a searche node can also not be pruned, so performing the TDG calculation is pointless. These case distinctions have not been implemented in this pruning technique, however.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
planLength
Prune a plan based on its length.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "planLength" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

You need to pass on an integer n as parameter to this key. Any plan with strictly more tasks (primitive or abstract) than this number will be discarded. You do this by putting the respective plan length n in parentheses.
\n
Please be aware that in case of hierarchical planning with "empty" decomposition methods (i.e., methods that allow the decomposition into an empty task network) there might be unintended or wrong behavior. The reason is that in these cases, the current plan size is not an admissible estimate of the final plan size. Incorporating the admissible TDG-c heuristic (see heuristic "TDG-c" for more information) would eliminate this undesired behavior and even be more effective, because plans can be pruned earlier. This has not been implemented at the moment, however.

By default, negative preconditions are compiled away in the usual way. However, the plan space-based planner PANDA3 as well as PANDA-totSAT (not yet delivered) can also cope with negative preconditions natively. Choosing this option will *not* compile them away.
\n
Please note that this feature has not been tested for a long time, so it can be regarded experimenatal. In particular, the planning graph (on which many heuristics and grounding procedures for hierarchical planning rely) has not been tested without compilation of negative preconditions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-liftedPlanning
Perform lifted (instead of ground) planning.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "-liftedPlanning" IS A SWITCH, NOT AN OPTION.

By default, the plan space-based planner PANDA3 relies on a ground model. However, the underlying planning procedure also supports lifted planning, which follows the least commitment principle to a larger extent (it omits early commitment by binding variables only if required). This changes the available plan modification options, of course, because flaws and modifications then need to cope with (unbound) variables. Note that certain heuristics might not be available anymore, since they might rely on a ground model.

Please carefully choose the available options (especially for preprocessing and heuristics) for PANDA3 when choosing this option. For instance, the option -primitiveReachablity (which grounds the model based on a planning graph) is chosen by default, *even* when lifted planning is chosen. This still makes sense, because also the lifted model might be reduced bases on a ground reachability analysis. However, you might still want to prevent grounding altogether when you choose to plan in a lifted fashion; in this case, you should deactivate the grounded reachability analysis.

Please be aware that choosing *additional* options might contradict the options chosen here; options are *performed* in the order they are set, so specifying "-systemConfig CONF1 -optionX Y" will perfrom "optionX = Y" even the system configuration CONF1 will explicitly state the opposite. This is especially important when you want to reproduce results from scientific papers; then, you should not choose any further options.

UMCP
Simulate the system UMCP within PANDA3.
THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "UMCP" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

The plan space-based planning system UMCP by Erol et al. can be simulated within the PANDA3 planner. UMCP is basically a standard plan space-based HTN planning system that uses different search strategies for selecting a most promising plan from a search fringe. In contrast to PANDA3, UMCP "fixates" a primitive plan as soon as one is found and then either turns it into a solution (if possible) or discards it in case this is impossible. Only after this has been done, a different plan is taken from the fringe. Note that our simulation of this relies on the standard POCL planning techniques, i.e., also proving that a primitive plan can be turned into a solution is done relying on this technique (i.e, this is not done with just one single search node, but via search as well). We do this via a depth-first search (i.e., as soon as a primitive plan is found, PANDA3 switches to depth-first *for this plan* before another plan is considered according to the primary UMCP search strategy).
\n
In accordance to the UMCP search algorithm (which is not a POCL procedure, though), we always pick an abstract task flaw. Ties are broken using the LCFR flaw selector (this is not reporated in the UMCP paper, but it gives good results on average).

The basic planning algorithm is given in Fig. 4 in the following paper:

AI planning research has focused on general-purpose planning systems which can process the specifications of an application domain and generate solutions to planning problems in that domain. Unfortunately, there is a big gap between theoretical and application oriented work in AI planning. The theoretical work has been mostly based on state-based planning, which has limited practical applications. The application- oriented work has been based on hierarchical task network (HTN) planning, which lacks a theoretical foundation. As a result, in spite of many years of research, building planning applications remains a formidable task. The goal of this dissertation is to facilitate building reliable and effective planning applications. The methodology includes design of a mathematical framework for HTN planning, analysis of this framework, development of provably correct algorithms based on this analysis, and the implementation of these algorithms for further evaluation and exploration. The representation, analyses, and algorithms described in this thesis will make it easier to apply HTN planning techniques effectively and correctly to planning applications. The precise and mathematical nature of the descriptions will also help teaching about HTN planning, will clarify misconceptions in the literature, and will stimulate further research.}

THIS LINE DOES CURRENTLY NOT SHOW BECAUSE "verify" IS A KEY, NOT AN OPTION.

  Abstract                 = {Plan-Verification is the task of determining whether a plan is a solution to a given planning problem. Any plan verifier has, apart from showing that verifying plans is possible in practice, a wide range of possible applications. These include mixed-initiative planning, where a user is integrated into the planning process, and local search, e.g., for post-optimising plans or for plan repair. In addition to its practical interest, plan verification is also a problem worth investigating for theoretical reasons. Recent work showed plan verification for hierarchical planning problems to be NP-complete, as opposed to classical planning where it is in P. As such, plan verification for hierarchical planning problem was – until now – not possible. We describe the first plan verifier for hierarchical planning. It uses a translation of the problem into a SAT formula. Further we conduct an empirical evaluation, showing that the correct output is produced within acceptable time.},
